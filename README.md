# Bimetallic core-shell nanoclusters
Information about the structure of metallic and bimetallic nanoclusters including fcc and amorphous structures of different sizes.
Each archive contains *XYZ* files of structural information of nanoclusters with a specific size and different compositions. 
There are core-shell nanoclusters Me@Pt, where Me = Ag, Au, Cu, Co, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Rh, Pt, Ru
