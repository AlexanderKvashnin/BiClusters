# Bimetallic core-shell nanoclusters


Information about the structure of metallic and bimetallic nanoclusters including fcc and amorphous structures of different sizes.

Each archive contains *XYZ* files of structural information of nanoclusters with a specific size and different compositions where the final column is the d-band center of each atom. 

There are core-shell nanoclusters Me@Pt, where Me = Ag, Au, Cu, Co, Ir, Ni, Os, Pd, Rh, Pt, Ru
